If you're using this in a <img> tag in React, this won’t work by itself:

<img src={image.path} /> // ❌ will NOT load the image
Why? Because bundlers like Webpack or Vite don't automatically resolve relative string paths from JS at runtime.

To make it work, you must import or require() the image:
If you're stuck on using the string path, you'd need to dynamically require it:

js
Copy
Edit
const images = [
  {
    id: 1,
    path: require('../../images/image1.png'),
  },
];
