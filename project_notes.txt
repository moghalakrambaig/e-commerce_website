If you're using this in a <img> tag in React, this won’t work by itself:

<img src={image.path} /> // ❌ will NOT load the image
Why? Because bundlers like Webpack or Vite don't automatically resolve relative string paths from JS at runtime.

To make it work, you must import or require() the image:
If you're stuck on using the string path, you'd need to dynamically require it:

js
Copy
Edit
const images = [
  {
    id: 1,
    path: require('../../images/image1.png'),
  },
];

added product cards carousal below main carousal
added arrows from https://mui.com/material-ui/material-icons/?query=left&selected=KeyboardArrowLeft

6/7/2025:
home slider prev and next not working on alice carousal 2.9
install 2.7.2 version

npm uninstall react-alice-carousel
npm install react-alice-carousel@2.7.1
npm prune
npm cache clean --force

Sliding was not smooth
addedconst carouselRef = useRef();
() => carouselRef.current?.slideNext()
() => carouselRef.current?.slidePrev()
                    autoPlayInterval={1000}
                    responsive={responsive}
                    animationDuration={700} // Controls smoothness
                    onSlideChanged={handleSlideChanged}
                    infinite={false}
                    activeIndex={activeIndex}

made the button effect smooth by decreasing animation duration to 300
comments inside parent tag must be in {/*agfiqHfoqwf*/}

slider slides slow due to large image size
resize the image or compress to load faster and slide smooth

added js file with product data in json format
and added more sliders in the home page with titles
